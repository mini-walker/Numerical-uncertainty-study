# üìò Estimate the Numerical Uncertainty for CFD Simulation

This repository provides MATLAB code and published research for estimating the **numerical uncertainty** in **Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)** simulations. The methodology is based on **grid convergence studies** and follows recognized standards such as the **Grid Convergence Index (GCI)** and **Richardson Extrapolation**.
